# Cleaning Zoom transcript files
A small program that cleans up auto-generated Zoom transcripts. 

## Get started
1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. Add a Zoom generated transcript files to the `raw` folder. 
3. Navigate to the root directory and run `python cleanData.py`
4. Open the `clean` folder to find your cleaned transcripts. 

### Troubleshooting
This didn't work for me when my directory was based in OneDrive. Try moving the folder to your local drive if you run into errors.
